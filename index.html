            <p align ="center" style = "color:#1061ed">Roland Guerriere is the son of god, here's why. <br>
            Roland was sacrificed on the cross and walked on water, don't ask for evidence because he did, don't ask questions either. Roland has also done many other miracles such as:
             Multiplying fish, <br>turning water into wine, healing people, and most impressive of all, he was resurected. Roland has preached the word of god himself, he has
            spoken the ten commandments which are:</p>

            <p align ="left" style = "color:#35a622"><br> 1: Popes will touch little boys
            <br> 2: The penalty for being gay is a hurricane
            <br> 3: Keep your mouth shut, God is very unpreditctable and unstable, and gets pissed easily
            <br> 4: Trump is the messiah
            <br> 5: Treat people how you want to be treated, because everyone on planet earth thinks the same way
            <br> 6: Vaccines are bad
            <br> 7: Evolution is not true, don't question it
            <br> 8: Adam rode on dinosaurs
            <br> 9: Every good thing came from god and every bad thing came from satan, but if you like something and it isn't mentioned in the bible, it's satanic
            <br> 10: These are God's words and everyone must follow them or they will be stoned.</p>

            <p align = "center" style = "color:#1061ed"> When Roland was sacrificed on the cross he was resurected 3 days later. While there is absolutely no evidence to support this claim you should still
            <br>beleive it because he is god after all. When Roland was resurected he did what every god would do if he was resurected, say hi to people in their
            <br>dreams and do no more miracles.</p>
